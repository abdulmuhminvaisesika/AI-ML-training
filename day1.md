# Artificial Intelligence
* Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think and act like humans. 
* It involves the development of algorithms and computer programs that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and language translation. 

## Types of Artificial Intelligence
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is broadly classified into:

1. Types of AI Based on Capabilities
2. Types of AI Based on Functionalities

















# Different Types of Machine learning: Supervised, unsupervised

Machine learning (ML) is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI). It enables systems to learn from data, identify patterns, and make decisions with minimal human intervention.

The three primary types of ML are:

1. Supervised Learning – Learning from labeled data.
2. Unsupervised Learning – Discovering patterns in unlabeled data.
3. Reinforcement Learning – Learning through interactions with an environment.

## Supervised Learning

* Supervised learning is like learning with a teacher. 
* The model is trained on a labeled dataset, meaning each input has a corresponding output.
* characteristics
    * Labeled Data: Training data has predefined labels.
    * ypes of Problems: Used for classification (e.g., spam detection) and regression (e.g., predicting house prices).
    * Algorithms: Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Trees, Neural Networks.


## Unsupervised Learning

* Unsupervised learning works with data that has no predefined labels. 
* The model identifies patterns, clusters, or associations independently.
* characteristics
  * Unlabeled Data: No predefined outputs.
  * Types of Problems: Clustering (e.g., customer segmentation) and association (e.g., market basket analysis).
  * Algorithms: K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering, PCA, Autoencoders.


## Reinforcement Learning (RL)


* Reinforcement learning involves an agent that interacts with an environment, learning through rewards and penalties to maximize long-term success.
* characteristics
    * Interaction-Based Learning: The agent learns by taking actions and receiving feedback.
    * No Labeled Data: Learns from trial and error.
    * Algorithms: Q-learning, SARSA, Deep Q-Networks (DQN).



# Machine Learning Algorithms

* Machine learning algorithms are essentially sets of instructions that allow computers to learn from data, make predictions, and improve their performance over time without being explicitly programmed.

## Supervised Learning Algorithms

1. Linear Regression

* Linear regression is used to predict a continuous value by finding the best-fit straight line between input (independent variable) and output (dependent variable)

2. Logistic Regression
